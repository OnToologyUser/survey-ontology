# Transmodel Ontology

A TransModel Ontology focused on Stops (Topography), Scheduling and Fares (at least).


# Purpose and scope of the vocabulary

With the ultimate goal of enabling the provision of multimodal transportation services, the EU Regulation 2017/1926 is requiring transport stakeholders to allow access to their data in specific data formats (i.e., NeTEx, SIRI).

Currently, the requested data formats are rarely used, thus a data conversion is needed.  The [SNAP](https://www.snap-project.eu) solution supports data conversion, decreasing the time required to perform it and hiding its complexity. 

At the same time, the base URI https://w3id.org/transmodel/terms# is already reserved by Pieter Colpaert, in the context of work in a CEN Transmodel working group.

# Development phases

The material generated in the different activities carried out during the development of the vocabulary, use
cases, user stories, glossary of terms, etc., will be available in the [Vocabulary Wiki](#)

# Project maintenance

To manage those incidents or suggested improvements with respect to the vocabulary, we recommend you to follow
the guides provided in [Issues Management](https://github.com/nombre-repositorio/wiki/issues-management) to
generate an issue (work in progress)

# Examples

Some [queries](https://github.com/repository-name/blob/master/examples/queries.md) will be performed in a
SPARQL endpoint to test and exemplify its operability.
