# Development phases

The material generated in the different activities carried out during the development of the vocabulary, use
cases, user stories, glossary of terms, etc., will be available in the [Vocabulary Wiki](#)

# Project maintenance

To manage those incidents or suggested improvements with respect to the vocabulary, we recommend you to follow
the guides provided in [Issues Management](https://github.com/marioscrock/survey-ontology/wiki/issues-management) to
generate an issue (work in progress)

# Examples

Some [queries](https://github.com/marioscrock/survey-ontology/blob/master/examples/queries.md) will be performed in a
SPARQL endpoint to test and exemplify its operability.
